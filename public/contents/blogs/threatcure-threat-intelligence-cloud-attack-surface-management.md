# **ThreatCure’s Use of Threat Intelligence in Cloud Attack Surface Management**

## **The Role of Cloud Attack Surface Management**

Cloud computing has transformed the way businesses operate, delivering unmatched scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. However, as organizations migrate sensitive data and workloads to cloud and hybrid environments, the attack surface expands significantly, introducing new and complex security challenges.

**Cloud Attack Surface Management (BASM)** is critical for identifying exposed assets, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and potential entry points that adversaries can exploit.

---

## **How ThreatCure Uses Threat Intelligence**

ThreatCure leverages **threat intelligence** as a foundational element of its Cloud Attack Surface Management strategy. By continuously monitoring the evolving threat landscape, ThreatCure identifies potential loopholes, assesses risks, evaluates impact, and deploys effective countermeasures to protect customer environments.

This intelligence-driven approach ensures proactive defense rather than reactive security.

## **Understanding Threat Intelligence**

Threat intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about current and emerging threats to IT assets. It transforms raw data into actionable insights that organizations can use to strengthen their defenses.

Threat intelligence is commonly categorized into three types:

- **Tactical Intelligence:**  
  Focuses on immediate threats, providing actionable indicators to prevent or mitigate active attacks.

- **Operational Intelligence:**  
  Offers insight into attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), helping organizations understand how threats operate.

- **Strategic Intelligence:**  
  Delivers long-term perspectives on adversary motivations, capabilities, and intent, enabling informed security planning.

---

## **The Threat Intelligence Lifecycle**

Threat intelligence follows a continuous and adaptive lifecycle:

1. **Collection:**  
   Gathering data from internal and external sources.

2. **Processing:**  
   Cleaning, structuring, and normalizing raw data.

3. **Analysis:**  
   Identifying patterns, correlations, and indicators of compromise.

4. **Dissemination:**  
   Delivering intelligence to relevant teams and systems.

5. **Feedback:**  
   Refining intelligence processes based on outcomes and user input.

## **ThreatCure’s Threat Intelligence Framework**

ThreatCure’s framework combines advanced technologies with human expertise to deliver comprehensive cloud security insights. Key components include:

- **Data Collection:**  
  Aggregating intelligence from OSINT, dark web monitoring, threat feeds, and customer environments.

- **Data Enrichment:**  
  Correlating and contextualizing data to prioritize high-risk threats.

- **Threat Analysis:**  
  Using algorithms and expert analysts to uncover indicators of compromise (IOCs) and emerging attack trends.

- **Threat Modeling:**  
  Simulating attack paths and assessing vulnerabilities across cloud assets.

- **Intelligence Dissemination:**  
  Providing actionable insights through dashboards, APIs, and detailed reports.

## **Application of Threat Intelligence in Cloud Attack Surface Management**

Threat intelligence plays a critical role in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across cloud and hybrid environments. It enables organizations to address cloud-specific threats such as:

- Misconfigurations and exposed assets  
- Data breaches and unauthorized access  
- Insider threats  
- Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks  
- Ransomware and advanced persistent threats  

Additionally, threat intelligence supports threat modeling, risk assessment, incident response, and proactive threat hunting.

## **ThreatCure’s Role in Protecting Cloud Attack Surface Management**

ThreatCure strengthens cloud security through its **Breach and Attack Surface Management (BASM) Platform**, powered by advanced threat intelligence. Its multi-layered approach includes:

- **Proactive Threat Detection:**  
  Identifying emerging threats and vulnerabilities before exploitation.

- **Real-Time Threat Prevention:**  
  Defending against both known and unknown attack vectors.

- **Incident Response and Remediation:**  
  Rapid containment and recovery to minimize operational impact.

ThreatCure also contributes to a stronger cloud security ecosystem by sharing threat intelligence with the wider community, improving awareness, and enhancing collective defense.

---

## **The Future of Threat Intelligence and Cloud Surface Management**

As the threat landscape evolves, new risks such as supply chain attacks, API vulnerabilities, and insider threats continue to emerge. Integrating threat intelligence–driven **BASM** with technologies like **SIEM, IDPS, EPP, and SOAR** is essential for building resilient defense strategies.

The adoption of **Generative AI and automation** will further accelerate threat detection, improve analyst visibility, and enhance response capabilities.

---

## **Conclusion**

Cloud Attack Surface Management is vital for organizations seeking to secure modern cloud environments. By understanding adversary TTPs and continuously monitoring exposure, organizations can proactively defend against evolving threats.

**ThreatCure BASM** leads the way by combining advanced threat intelligence, automation, and human expertise to deliver comprehensive, future-ready cloud security solutions.
