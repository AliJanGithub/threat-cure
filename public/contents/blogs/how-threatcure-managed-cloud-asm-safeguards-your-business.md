# **How ThreatCure’s Managed Cloud ASM Safeguards Your Business in the Age of Expanding Attack Surfaces**

The digital revolution has transformed the business world, pushing companies rapidly toward cloud adoption. While cloud technology brings scalability, flexibility, and global accessibility, it also dramatically expands your organization’s **attack surface**. Every cloud asset, exposed service, misconfigured permission, and forgotten endpoint becomes a potential entry point for cybercriminals.

**ThreatCure’s Managed Cloud ASM** provides a 360° security shield, continuously identifying vulnerabilities *before* attackers attempt to exploit them.

# **The Ever-Present Threat Landscape: Why Proactive Cloud Security Is Critical**

The cyber threat landscape evolves daily. Attackers—with increasing sophistication—actively search for misconfigurations, weak identity policies, and exposed cloud endpoints.

## **1. The Expanding Attack Surface**
Cloud ecosystems are large, distributed, and constantly changing.  
This introduces countless attack vectors that are impossible to track manually.

## **2. Hidden Blind Spots**
Most companies do not fully know what assets are exposed.  
ASM provides complete visibility across cloud infrastructure.

## **3. Reactive Security Is Not Enough**
A “wait and respond” strategy fails in modern cloud environments.  
ASM identifies and fixes issues *before* they become breaches.
