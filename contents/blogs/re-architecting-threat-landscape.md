# **Re-Architecting the Threat Landscape**

## **What is the Threat Landscape?**

The **threat landscape** refers to the current environment of cyber threats that an organization or individual may face. This includes the various types of cyber-attacks and the vulnerabilities they exploit.  

---

## **Why Update the Threat Landscape?**

Cyber threats constantly evolve, and traditional security measures may no longer suffice. Infrastructure is increasingly **distributed across on-premises, hybrid, and multiple cloud environments** (AWS, Google, Azure, etc.).  

By re-architecting your threat landscape with **ThreatCure’s approach**, organizations can:

- **Improve Security:** Defend against a broader spectrum of attacks across diverse infrastructures.  
- **Be Proactive:** Anticipate risks using the **ThreatCure Advanced Hunting Platform (ShieldOps)** before they escalate.  
- **Boost Resilience:** Recover and adapt more effectively after cyber-attacks.  

---

## **New and Emerging Threats**

As technology evolves, so do cyber threats. Key emerging threats include:

- **AI-Powered Attacks:** Cyber-attacks that leverage AI to evade detection and increase effectiveness.  
- **IoT Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in Internet of Things devices that often lack strong security measures.  
- **Cloud Security Risks:** Threats associated with storing and processing data across multiple cloud platforms.  

---

## **Steps to Update the Threat Landscape**

Updating your cybersecurity begins with a thorough assessment:

### **1. Identify Existing Threats with Maturity Assessment**
Evaluate current risks, their sources, and your organization’s capability to manage them.  

### **2. Evaluate Current Security Measures**
Determine how effectively current controls prevent or mitigate attacks.  

### **3. Conduct Cyber Drills**
- **Tabletop Exercises:** Simulate attack scenarios to refine response strategies.  
- **Scenario-Based Drills:** Assess operations team response times and adjust risk mitigation accordingly.

## **Implementing Advanced Security Technologies**

Modern cybersecurity relies on the latest tools and platforms:

- **Network Detection and Response (NDR):** Monitor and respond to threats on network devices like routers, switches, firewalls, and IDPS.  
- **Next-Generation Hunting Platform (ShieldOps):** Advanced platform for filtering and identifying sophisticated attacks.  
- **Security Orchestration, Automation & Response (SOAR):** Automates investigation and remediation of threats.  
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Monitors and mitigates threats on endpoint devices such as laptops and smartphones.  

---

## **Enhancing Threat Intelligence**

Integrating threat intelligence into your security strategy ensures proactive defense:

- **Understanding Threat Intelligence:** Gain insights into potential threats and their behavior.  
- **Sources of Threat Intelligence:** Collect data from security vendors, open-source platforms, and threat-sharing communities.  
- **Using Threat Intelligence:** Apply intelligence to strengthen security measures and inform decision-making.  

---

## **Conclusion**

Cyber threats and organizational infrastructures are constantly evolving. By:

- Reviewing existing security measures,  
- Assessing cyber maturity,  
- Deploying advanced hunting technologies, and  
- Leveraging actionable threat intelligence,  

**ThreatCure helps organizations strengthen protection, anticipate emerging threats, and improve resilience against sophisticated attacks.**
